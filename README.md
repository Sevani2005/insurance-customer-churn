Insurance Customer Churn Prediction

I've built this machine learning project to help insurance companies figure out which customers might cancel their policies soon. By digging into customer habits and policy details, the model spots at-risk folks early, so teams can reach out with personalized offers or support to keep them onboard and boost retention.

Tech Stack:

Python 

Pandas & NumPy for data  processing

Scikit-learn for quick baseline machine learning models

LightGBM for super-fast, accurate predictions

Day 1 – Project Initialization & Planning

Day 1 focused on setting up the project foundation. The insurance domain was finalized for customer churn prediction, and a suitable dataset was identified and reviewed at a high level. The GitHub repository was created with a clean project structure and proper documentation to support further development.

Key activities completed:
  - Finalized the insurance domain for churn prediction
  - Identified and reviewed a relevant insurance customer churn dataset
  - Defined the project objective and business use case
  - Created the GitHub repository and organized the folder structure
  - Added clear project documentation in the README
  - Committed and pushed the initial setup to GitHub
