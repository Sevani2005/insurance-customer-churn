Insurance Customer Churn Prediction

I've built this machine learning project to help insurance companies figure out which customers might cancel their policies soon. By digging into customer habits and policy details, the model spots at-risk folks early, so teams can reach out with personalized offers or support to keep them onboard and boost retention.

Tech Stack:

Python

Pandas \& NumPy for data  processing

Scikit-learn for quick baseline machine learning models

LightGBM for super-fast, accurate predictions

Day 1 – Project Setup \& Planning

On day 1, I finalized the project idea and prepared the basic setup required to start development. I selected the insurance domain and planned how the churn prediction system would be built step by step.

What I did:
-Selected insurance customer churn as the project problem
-Identified a suitable dataset for the project
-Planned the overall project workflow
-Created the project folder structure
-Initialized the GitHub repository and pushed the initial file

Day 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

On day2, I focused on understanding the dataset in detail. I explored the structure of the data, analyzed customer churn distribution, and identified important patterns that would help in building an effective prediction model.

What I did:
 -Loaded the insurance churn dataset
 -Understood the columns and data types
 -Checked how many customers churned vs not churned
 -Observed basic patterns and relationships in the data
 -Got the data ready for model building 
 
 Day 3 – Model Development

 On Day 3, I worked on building the churn prediction model using machine learning.I focused on training the model and preparing it for future predictions.

What I did:
 -Selected LightGBM algorithm for churn prediction
 -split the dataset into training and testing sets
 -Trained the model using the training data
 -Saved the trained logic inside the src folder
