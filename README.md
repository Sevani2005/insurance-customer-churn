Insurance Customer Churn Prediction

I've built this machine learning project to help insurance companies figure out which customers might cancel their policies soon. By digging into customer habits and policy details, the model spots at-risk folks early, so teams can reach out with personalized offers or support to keep them onboard and boost retention.

Tech Stack:

Python 

Pandas & NumPy for data  processing

Scikit-learn for quick baseline machine learning models

LightGBM for super-fast, accurate predictions
