Insurance Customer Churn Prediction

I've built this machine learning project to help insurance companies figure out which customers might cancel their policies soon. By digging into customer habits and policy details, the model spots at-risk folks early, so teams can reach out with personalized offers or support to keep them onboard and boost retention.

Tech Stack:

Python 

Pandas & NumPy for data  processing

Scikit-learn for quick baseline machine learning models

LightGBM for super-fast, accurate predictions

Day 1 – Project Setup & Planning

Today, I started the project by setting everything up. I chose the insurance domain to predict customer churn and found a dataset for it. I also created a GitHub repository with a clean structure and added clear documentation to make future work easier.

What I did:
 -Chose the insurance domain for churn prediction
 -Found and reviewed a relevant dataset
 -Defined the project goal and purpose
 -Set up a GitHub repository with organized folders
 -Added clear notes in the README
 -Committed and pushed the initial setup to GitHub
