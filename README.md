Insurance Customer Churn Prediction

I've built this machine learning project to help insurance companies figure out which customers might cancel their policies soon. By digging into customer habits and policy details, the model spots at-risk folks early, so teams can reach out with personalized offers or support to keep them onboard and boost retention.

Tech Stack:

Python 

Pandas & NumPy for data  processing

Scikit-learn for quick baseline machine learning models

LightGBM for super-fast, accurate predictions

Day 1 – Project Setup & Planning

Today, I started the project by setting everything up. I chose the insurance domain to predict customer churn and found a dataset for it. I also created a GitHub repository with a clean structure and added clear documentation to make future work easier.

What I did:
 -Chose the insurance domain for churn prediction
 -Found and reviewed a relevant dataset
 -Defined the project goal and purpose
 -Set up a GitHub repository with organized folders
 -Added clear notes in the README
 -Committed and pushed the initial setup to GitHub

Day 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Loaded the insurance churn dataset
- Understood the columns and data types
- Checked how many customers churned vs not churned
- Observed basic patterns and relationships in the data
- Got the data ready for model building

Day 3 – Model Development

On Day 3, I worked on building the churn prediction model using machine learning.
I focused on training the model and preparing it for future predictions.

What I did:
-Selected LightGBM algorithm for churn prediction
-split the dataset into training and testing sets
-Trained the model using the training data
-Saved the trained logic inside the src folder

Day 4 – Model Insights

On day 4, I worked on understanding how the churn prediction model behaves.

What I did:
 -Checked model performance
 -Looked at feature importance
 -Analyzed predictions and results
 -Added insights in model_insights.ipynb

Day 5 – Saving the AI Logic
Today, I focused on making sure the AI's "brain" was ready for the real world. After fine-tuning the model, I saved it as a file so that I could use it in my application without having to train it every single time. 

What I did:
- Finalized the best version of my LightGBM model.
- Saved the trained model into the `models/` folder.
- Cleaned up my code folders to keep things organized.

Day 6 – Building the Modern Dashboard
This was an exciting day! I built a website (using Streamlit) so that anyone could actually use my AI. I wanted it to be more than just numbers, so I added interactive charts and a special feature that tells you exactly what to do next to keep a customer.

What I did:
- Created a beautiful, interactive dashboard.
- Added a "Single Prediction" tool for one-on-one checks.
- Added a "Batch Analysis" tool to check thousands of customers at once.
- Added visual charts to show where the risks are.

Day 7 – Polishing and Final Testing
I spent the last day making everything look professional and fixing small bugs. I removed all the "toy" elements and went with a clean, solid design that looks like a real corporate tool. I also made sure all the files were synced and ready for deployment.

What I did:
- Cleaned up the UI for a professional "Solid Color" look.
- Added a "Recent Checks" history feature to the sidebar.
- Fixed small bugs to make sure everything runs perfectly.
- Finalized the documentation and requirements for the launch.

### 🛡️ Conclusion
This project was a journey from raw data to a real-world business tool. By combining **LightGBM Machine Learning** with a clean **Streamlit Dashboard**, I've created a system that doesn't just predict the future—it helps insurance companies change it. 

Through this 7-day process, I’ve built a bridge between complex AI logic and actionable business decisions. This project is now fully ready to help retention teams save customers and grow their business.
